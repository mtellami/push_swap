### 🔥Sorting Algorithms🔥
</div>

> This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

### ♦️  Topic
  -  What is a Stack ?
  -  Sorting algorithms ?
  - ⚠ its all about burning your mind NOT keep repeating useless information you memorize.

### ♦️  Mandatory
  - 🔹 Creating operations (sa, sb, ss, pa, pb, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb, rrr).
  - 🔹 Check for invalid input (non numeric value, max/min int, duplicated numbers).
  - 🔹 Create two stacks (A, B) and check if A is already sorted.
  - 🔹 make your algorithm based on stack A size.

### ♦️  Bonus
  - 🔹 Checking errors (same as mandatory).
  - 🔹 Reading instructions from standard input, valid ? execute : error.
  - 🔹 A is sorted ? "OK" : "KO".
