### 🔥Sorting Algorithms🔥
</div>

> This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

### ♦️  Topic
  - #### What is a Stack ?</br>
  A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first.
  - #### Sorting algorithms ?</br>
  A sorting algorithm is used to arrange elements of an array/list in a specific order, there are various sorting algorithms that can be used to complete this operation.</br>The efficiency of any sorting algorithm is determined by the time complexity and space complexity of the algorithm.

### ♦️  Mandatory
  - 🔹 Creating operations (sa, sb, ss, pa, pb, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb, rrr).
  - 🔹 Check for invalid input (non numeric value, max/min int, duplicated numbers).
  - 🔹 Create two stacks (A, B) and check if A is already sorted.
  - 🔹 make your algorithm based on stack A size.

### ♦️  Bonus
  - 🔹 Checking errors (same as mandatory).
  - 🔹 Reading instructions from standard input, valid ? execute : error.
  - 🔹 A is sorted ? "OK" : "KO".
